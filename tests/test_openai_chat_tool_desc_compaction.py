"""Tool-description compaction must run on chat-completions, not just Anthropic/Responses.

``HEADROOM_TOOL_DESC_MAX_CHARS`` was wired into the Anthropic handler and the
Responses (Codex) handler but never into chat-completions, so the env var was a
silent no-op for every chat client — opencode, Cline, Aider, Roo, anything routed
through LiteLLM. Tool descriptions live on the ``tools`` array, which the message
pipeline never inspects, so no other pass was covering them.

These tests pin the shape handling and the opt-in gate rather than driving the
whole handler: the handler block is a thin adapter over
``compact_tool_descriptions``, and the thing that actually broke was that nobody
called it with the chat-shaped payload.
